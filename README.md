# Todo-web App with React.js

I have created a highly responsive Todo-web app using React.js that allows users to efficiently manage tasks. The app offers seamless task addition, removal, and updating functionalities, making task management effortless. Developed with the power of React Vite, it ensures fast and smooth development, delivering an optimal user experience.

## Key Features

- Add tasks easily
- Remove tasks with a click
- Update tasks effortlessly

## Live Demo
